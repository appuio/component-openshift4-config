      This is a config map that's deployed via Commodore component
      openshift4-config and which is intended to be consumed by other
      Commodore components.

      OpenShift uses a separate config map called `user-ca-bundle` in this
      namespace to extend the system wide trusted CA bundle. See parameter
      `trustedCA` in Commodore component `openshift4-proxy` to configure
      that config map.
