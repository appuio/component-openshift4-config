= openshift4-config

openshift4-config is a Commodore component to manage openshift4-config.

Currently, this component can manage the global cluster pull secret as described in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html#images-update-global-pull-secret_using-image-pull-secret[OpenShift documentation].

Additionally, the component deploys custom `ClusterRole` resources which are aggregated to the `cluster-reader` cluster role.
Currently, the component aggregates `get/list/watch` permissions for the following API groups to the `cluster-reader` role:

* `operator.openshift.io`
* `networking.k8s.io`

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
